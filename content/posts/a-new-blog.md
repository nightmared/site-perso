Hello everyone !
I juste made a very tiny static website with the help of the fantastic [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). It's a really awesome tool to build static website fairly easily.

I really advise you to go on and try it out !

Anyway, the (short) sources of this website are available under the Mozilla Public License on Github: [site-perso](https://github.com/nightmared/site-perso) and its terrible corresponding theme: [yaht](https://github.com/nightmared/yaht). That said, if I were you, I would preserve my brain and curb my enthusiasm to check it out, for nobody likes to read bad code ;-)
