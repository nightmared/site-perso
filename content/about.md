I'm Simon THOBY, an [ENSEEIHT](http://www.enseeiht.fr/en/) student fascinated by computer science.

My main centers of interest, as I just said, are computer security (including cryptography), development (in C, Rust and sometimes shell scripts when I want to do horribleC^W hacky stuff), reading some fantasy/sci-phy books.

I am a fervent enthusiast of FOSS (Free and Open-Source Software) such as Mozilla's browser, the famous community-driven language [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) or voidlinux package manager, [xbps](https://github.com/void-linux/xbps) (try it out, it's insanely fast compared to rpm and aptitude. Besides, the shlibs management, albeit primitive, is rather efficient).

I have a great interest in the BSD, despite the difficulty of migrating from Linux to BSD considering the current filesystems situation: ZFS may be the only viable alternative, but it doesn't work alongside cryptsetup to the best of my knowledge. That's why I'm still on [Void Linux](https://voidlinux.org). However, I have to admit there is plenty of great ideas in the [NixOS](https://nixos.org) distribution.

Anyway, that's all I can say !
