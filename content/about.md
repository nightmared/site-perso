I'm Simon, amd my dubious pseudo is *nightmared*.

At work, I'm a Computer Security Engineer, aka. someone that knows computer security is hopeless but have come to terms with that idea, and is meekly trying not to degrade the situation further.

Outside of work, I'm just a french guy - so yes, I eat *baguette*s, but who doesn't? - that likes watching mindless TV series, reading some fantasy/sci-fi books (currently churning through the great *The Wheel of Time*), and expressing patently wrong ideas about computers.

But seeing as I'm neither a TV or book critic, I can only assume you landed on this page because you were either deeply lost on the internet, or looking for something related to computers. If you are lost, I believe you know what to do (`pkill -9 firefox`).

If you are of the latter breed, I must confess I still na√Øvely believes in the idea of Free Software, and I tremendously enjoy using the heaps of free software that were developed in the past few decades, particularly Mozilla Firefox, Rust's ecosystem (the language, not the game), Nix/NixOS (of which I'm a happy, but heavily conflicted user), sway, alacritty, systemd, ...

I also sometimes do some light development (mostly in Rust and Python, with some very light touch of C and shell scripts when I want to write quick & dirty one-off code), which you may (or not) find on github or gitlab.com.

Anyway, that's all I can say!
